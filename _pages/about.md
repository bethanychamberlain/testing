PURRLab research interests lie within the broad area of trustworthy machine learning and its applications to medical imaging with a focus on datasets.  We are particularly interested in understanding the similarity and diversity of datasets, methods for learning with limited labeled data such a transfer learning, and meta-research on machine learning in medical imaging.

The best way to get a sense of whatâ€™s currently going on in the lab is to check out our [projects](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/) page.

PURRLab is a part of [DASYA](https://dasya.itu.dk/) research group in the department of Computer Science at the IT University of Copenhagen. and is led by Veronika Cheplygina.

<!--- CHECK/UPDATE LINKS -->
PURRLab research is being supported by the Dutch Research Council ([HINTS](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/1_hints/)); Novo Nordisk Foundation ([CATS](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/2_cats/)); and the Independent Research Council of Denmark ([MMC]([PROJECT LINK](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/3_mmc/))).

# Lab Vision
Our lab focuses on improving the use of machine learning methods in medical image analysis. On the one hand, this means developing methods which can learn from a limited amount of labeled data, such as multiple instance learning, transfer learning and crowdsourcing. On the other hand, this means evaluating whether these methods are reliable, and whether they generalize to other types of data. I want the lab to be a place where everybody is excited about the research with do, and how we do it.

Although we will work on different projects, I think the key is to act as a team working towards a common goal of advancing medical imaging research. On the science side, this means focusing on the quality of the research, openly sharing our (positive and negative) results and contributing to the medical imaging research community. On the team side, this means supporting each other both with successes and failures, and motivating each other to be the best researchers and team members that we can be. To achieve this, I hope that as a lab we can do the following:

- We search for important questions to answer, and not just to get state-of-the-art performance in an application.
- We read broadly and try to connect different parts of the literature to create new insights - often by brainstorming together.
- We work together, share any successes or failures, and help each other out in case of problems
- We work on creating things that others can use, both within and outside the lab. This means writing preprints or blog posts, sharing reproducible code with good documentation, and building up useful resources (such as a list of relevant literature, toolboxes, best practices etc).
- We set deadlines for finishing the projects we work on, for example by submitting the work to a journal or conference. A project is successful if we are proud of the work we did and shared it with the rest of the world. Getting it accepted is a bonus.
- We take initiative and actively contribute to the lab, and suggest ways to improve the process further

# Lab Culture

## Principles that guide us:
- Study rigorously without cutting corners
- Serve the community by writing tutorials, give lectures or workshops, etc
- Maintain critical outlook of our own work and others
- Denounce any form of discrimination

## Best practices as a lab:

### Data Analysis
- Reproducibility and transparency
- Robustness
- Mindfulness

### Writing
- Continuity
- Clarity
- Meaning

### Discussions
- Efficiency
- Criticism
- Mindfulness

# My (Veronika's) Expectations
The goal of this document is to establish what I expect from you, and what you can expect from me. Having an understanding of our mutual expectations is key to the success of a student/supervisor relationship.

## My Expectations of You
- I expect you to put your physical and mental health first. If you are having problems, please tell me about it. You do not need to tell me what is going on, but I will try to point you to places that can help.
- I expect that you will behave responsibly with your time. You should work on your project "full-time", but not more than that. For PhD projects and MSc projects (30 ECTS in one semester) this is roughly 36 hours per week, for other projects this scales with the ECTS involved. I do not expect you to spend all of that time at university. But, I expect that you will be in the lab at least some of the time that overlaps with others.
- I expect you to be in charge of your project and keep track of what you need to do on a todo list. Add any tasks that come up during a meeting to your todo list.
- I expect that you will respect my time by preparing in advance for meetings (as agreed). There will be circumstances when this is not possible (such as illness), please try to let me know in advance.
- I expect that your project will be a combination of my research interests and your own ideas. To generate ideas, you will need to read papers related to your research questions, brainstorm, try things out etc. A lab notebook and an annotated bibliography will help with this.
- I expect you to try to solve problems yourself first, if you can, but to ask for help (me of others) if you need.
- I expect that you will work towards a project that can be used by others. Next to writing your thesis, document and share your code on Github. Consider creating an app, a toolbox, or a blog post with what you have learned.
- I expect that you will contribute to the lab and the larger group/section, by joining lab/group meetings (and presenting or asking questions) and events, interacting with other students, etc. If you are doing a longer project, ask if you can contribute to general lab/group tasks.
- If you are doing a longer project, I expect that you will ask my advice on issues related to your professional development. I expect that you will consider that advice, but use your own judgement about taking it. I also encourage you to seek advice from other mentors.

## Your Expectations of Me
- You can expect me to be understanding if you are dealing with any physical or mental health problems, and if needed to point you to helpful resources.
- You can expect to meet with me approximately every week. If I am not able to be there, I will let you know in advance. If I am away, we might be able to meet via Teams, and I'm happy to answer short questions on Teams as well.
- You can expect me to help with tips on how to organize your project/todo-list, or point you in the direction where you can find more help - but I cannot keep track of it for you.
- You can expect me to do what I say I will do (meet, give feedback, etc) at the time that we agreed. There will be circumstances in which this will not always be possible, but I will do my best to alert you about this in advance.
- You can expect me to give you feedback about your progress. You can expect me to provide feedback on your writing, write you a recommendation letter, etc, if you ask in advance (1-2 weeks).
- You can expect me to help you define an interesting research project, give you suggestions for related literature and brainstorm with you about your topic.
- You can expect me to ask you questions to help you figure out an answer, and/or point you in the direction of where you can find an answer. I do not have all the answers anyway :)
- You can expect me to work on helping you publish your work and/or create something that other people can use.
- You can expect me to work hard on improving how this lab/group works, and (if you are doing a longer project) to ask you to contribute to lab/group tasks.
- If you are doing a longer project, you can expect me to alert you about interesting opportunities such as conferences, funding, jobs etc. You can expect me to give you advice on these topics, and to encourage you to find others who can give you advice.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
