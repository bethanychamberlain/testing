PURRLab research interests lie within the broad area of trustworthy machine learning and its applications to medical imaging with a focus on datasets.  We are particularly interested in understanding the similarity and diversity of datasets, methods for learning with limited labeled data such a transfer learning, and meta-research on machine learning in medical imaging.

The best way to get a sense of whatâ€™s currently going on in the lab is to check out our [projects](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/) page.

PURRLab is a part of [DASYA](https://dasya.itu.dk/) research group in the department of Computer Science at the IT University of Copenhagen. and is led by Veronika Cheplygina.

<!--- CHECK/UPDATE LINKS -->
PURRLab research is being supported by the Dutch Research Council ([HINTS](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/1_hints/)); Novo Nordisk Foundation ([CATS](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/2_cats/)); and the Independent Research Council of Denmark ([MMC]([PROJECT LINK](https://purrlab22.github.io/projects/3_mmc/))).

##### Lab Culture / Vision

This needs re-working, it's pasted from the vision/expectations of Notion

Our lab focuses on improving the use of machine learning methods in medical image analysis. On the one hand, this means developing methods which can learn from a limited amount of labeled data, such as multiple instance learning, transfer learning and crowdsourcing. On the other hand, this means evaluating whether these methods are reliable, and whether they generalize to other types of data. I want the lab to be a place where everybody is excited about the research with do, and how we do it.

Although we will work on different projects, I think the key is to act as a team working towards a common goal of advancing medical imaging research. On the science side, this means focusing on the quality of the research, openly sharing our (positive and negative) results and contributing to the medical imaging research community. On the team side, this means supporting each other both with successes and failures, and motivating each other to be the best researchers and team members that we can be. To achieve this, I hope that as a lab we can do the following:

- We search for important questions to answer, and not just to get state-of-the-art performance in an application.
- We read broadly and try to connect different parts of the literature to create new insights - often by brainstorming together.
- We work together, share any successes or failures, and help each other out in case of problems
- We work on creating things that others can use, both within and outside the lab. This means writing preprints or blog posts, sharing reproducible code with good documentation, and building up useful resources (such as a list of relevant literature, toolboxes, best practices etc).
- We set deadlines for finishing the projects we work on, for example by submitting the work to a journal or conference. A project is successful if we are proud of the work we did and shared it with the rest of the world. Getting it accepted is a bonus.
- We take initiative and actively contribute to the lab, and suggest ways to improve the process further



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
